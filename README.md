# BlackJack-Game

My final project for Grade 12 Computer Science Class. I was tasked to brainstorm and develop an original project within the scope of the course
and I developed a fully functional, singleplayer, BlackJack game using Python and TKinter. I chose not to use PyGame to give myself a bit more of
a challenge and learned a whole new game library to build it.

To play, simply import the files onto your choice of Software IDE and run the game. Type in a betting amount first and click "Start".

In this project, I learned recursive programming, object-oriented programming, building a simple AI for the opponent and developed game design
knowledge. I also developed a thorough understanding of TKinter and Python.
